> Understand that DevOps is not about a specific technology or a particular way of developing, but rather about a set of cultures and practices that lead to successful project development. These practices are primarily related to Dev (Development) and Ops (Operations/Infrastructure). Therefore, a DevOps professional must focus not only on code quality, technologies, and frameworks used, but also on deployment, storage, memory consumption, hosting, and other factors. In summary, DevOps is about delivering what the client wants in the best possible way, within the established deadline!

Here are some important things to consider when thinking about DevOps:

- Is the client requesting these features, or am I inventing unnecessary requirements?
- Does the system/application meet the desired needs?
- Who will use the system/application?
- Can anyone use the system/application easily?
- What type of architecture does the client use or want, and is my system compatible with that architecture?
- What criteria will I use to choose the technologies and frameworks for the project?
- Does the entire team know how to use these technologies and frameworks?
- On what type of operating system will the system run? Linux?
- Is the code well-organized?
- Can I know what was done just by looking at the commit message?
- Is the code tested before the release? Does it pass the tests?
- Is it easy to clearly identify where errors are in the code?
- Should I push the code directly to the main branch? Do I have a branching structure? What branching model should I adopt?
- Are my API keys or any private code encrypted or secured?
- Is the color scheme of the system/application appealing?
- What should I prioritize for delivery?
- What is the purpose of the project? What are my client's pain points, and how can I address them with my system/application?
- If any changes are made after deployment, how will the redeployment be handled? Will the system go down?
- Does my database have backups? Is it possible to recover data that is accidentally or intentionally deleted?

There are many other criteria and questions you can self-evaluate during development, and you should also ask yourself whether DevOps is truly responsible for everything mentioned above. The answer is: yes and no. The entire team, whether they like it or not, is responsible for the code, structure, tests, documentation, and so on. DevOps professionals specifically focus on ensuring the continuous integration and delivery of the project, as there are tasks that only a dedicated team can address and develop, such as testing, color choices, wireframe development, database modeling, etc. Therefore, we all have a bit of the DevOps culture within us. For those who specialize in the field, it‚Äôs about mastering the practices, characteristics, and analyses even further.
